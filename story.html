        <p>Once upon a time, in a lush forest, lived a mighty lion named Leo. One sunny afternoon, Leo was taking a nap under a big oak tree when he heard a tiny squeak. He opened his eyes and saw a little mouse running across his paw. Leo, startled, woke up and almost caught the mouse, but then he looked down and saw the tiny creature. Instead of swatting at it, he gently pushed his paw away, letting the mouse escape. </p>

        <p>The mouse, trembling, scurried away and soon forgot all about the lion. A few days later, Leo was caught in a trap. He roared loudly, but no one came to help. Just then, the little mouse, hearing the roar, remembered the kind lion and bravely scurried to him. He gnawed at the rope, bit by bit, until Leo was free.</p>

        <p> Leo, amazed, looked at the mouse. "Thank you," he said, his voice full of gratitude. "You saved me!" The little mouse, now a hero, just scurried away, happy that he could help. From that day on, Leo and the mouse became the best of friends, proving that even the smallest creature can be a great help. </p>
